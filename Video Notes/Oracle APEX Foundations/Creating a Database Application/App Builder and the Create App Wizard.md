App Builder and the Create App Wizard

- an application contains individual pages that are organized using containers called regions.

Think of it this way - a 'page' in the browser sense can be composed of multiple APEX pages, and regions determine how the BROWSER's page looks.  Regions will contain different APEX pages.

https://apexapps.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/apex_pm/ideas/home is a page made in APEX.
